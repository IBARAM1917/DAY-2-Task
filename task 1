difference between document and window objects
 DOCUMENT:
      The document object is the HTML document that appers in the browser window
      The browser generates a document object model of a web page upon loding it
      The document actulay gets loaded inside the window object
      The document is a part of BOM (browser object model) and DOM (document object model)
      properties of document objects such as title , body cookies, etc can also be assessed by a window document tittle
      We can access the document from a window using the window.document
      Its another name called   simply document
      To use the document object in the browser not a Notejs
