difference between document and window objects
 DOCUMENT:
      The document object is the HTML document that appers in the browser window
      The browser generates a document object model of a web page upon loding it
      The document actulay gets loaded inside the window object
      The document is a part of BOM (browser object model) and DOM (document object model)
      properties of document objects such as title , body cookies, etc can also be assessed by a window document tittle
      We can access the document from a window using the window.document 
      To use the document object in the browser not a Notejs 
 Syntax:
     document.propertyname;
 Example:
      document.tittle : will return the tittle of the document
 Methods:
      document.create element(element)
      document.removechild(element)
WINDOW OBJECTS:
      It represens a browser windows or fram that displays the contents of the webpage 
      It  is the very first object that is loaded in the browser
      The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser
      The window is part of BOM , not a DOM 
      Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object
      We can access the window from the window only (ie-window.window)
      window is a globel objectand its a browser engine to work 
 Syntax:
      window.propertyname;
